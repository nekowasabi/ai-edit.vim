fix(buffer): remove mode check from getVisualSelection

Remove mode check that was preventing :AiRewrite from working
in Visual mode. The mode check was causing false negatives
because Vim returns to Normal mode before the denops function
executes, even with denops#request().

Visual selection marks are still validated by isVisualSelectionValid(),
which is sufficient for determining if a selection exists.

Fixes the issue where :AiRewrite would show "No text selected"
error even when text was properly selected in Visual mode.

Changes:
- Removed fn.mode() call and mode validation in getVisualSelection()
- Updated JSDoc to clarify mark-based selection behavior
- Updated buffer_mode_test.ts to reflect new behavior
- Added :AiRewrite documentation to README.md
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with fix details

All 52 tests pass, type checking passes.
